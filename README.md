# InfluxDB Plugin

## Introduction

The InfluxDB Plugin is designed to seamlessly integrate Jenkins with InfluxDB. It facilitates the posting of detailed Jenkins job data into an InfluxDB database, enabling enhanced monitoring and analytics of CI/CD pipelines. This plugin collects comprehensive metrics from Jenkins jobs, including job name, build status, build duration, build number, and build time, along with the hierarchical folder structure of each job. These metrics are crucial for real-time and historical analysis of build performance, helping teams to optimize their development processes.
